I am an accomplished leader with over 20 years of experience in software development.

I began my career in engineering before joining Google as a UX Designer, where I worked on search experiences. I designed the original set of transit icons on Maps â€” which, to date, might be the only thing my family understands about my career. ðŸ˜‰

Later, I joined Etsy pre-IPO and helped build out their search and discovery experience, as well as a sustainable, high-margin revenue stream in the form of search-based advertising for sellers.

Since then, Iâ€™ve led product teams at Betterment (fintech), Casper (direct-to-consumer), and InVision (SaaS). Currently, Iâ€™m the VP of Product for the Slack Platform.

I reside in Brooklyn, NY, with my wife, two small daughters, and our not-always-helpful truffle dog, Sadie.
