I've seen and felt the unique challenges product leaders face: constant ambiguity and loneliness at the top. As we climb, we find fewer peers to bounce ideas off. Yet, everyone needs support to excel ‚Äî even writers have editors.

That's why I created Working Titles. We're all works in progress, continuously refining our skills.

Seeking a trusted sounding board? Navigating ambiguity? Adapting to industry shifts? You don't have to do it alone. We'll cut through the noise, sharpen your skills, and amplify your impact.

### Areas of Speciality
I'll tailor to your needs &mdash; no cookie-cutter process or rigid playbook.
