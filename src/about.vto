<p>I've seen and felt the unique challenges product leaders face: constant ambiguity and loneliness at the top. As we climb, we find fewer peers to bounce ideas off. Yet, everyone needs support to excel — even writers have editors.</p>

<p>That's why I created Working Titles. We're all works in progress, continuously refining our skills.</p>

<p>Seeking a trusted sounding board? Navigating ambiguity? Adapting to industry shifts? You don't have to do it alone. We'll cut through the noise and sharpen your skills to amplify your impact.</p>

<h3>Areas of Specialty</h3>
<p>I'll tailor to your needs &mdash; no cookie-cutter process. Available as fractional support.</p>
